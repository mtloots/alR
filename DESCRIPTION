Title: Arc Lengths of Statistical Functions
Description: Estimation, regression and classification are redefined using a mathematically intractible measure, namely, the arc length.  Functions for parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit and regression (linear and non-linear) are provided.  These methods have been implemented with parallel computing in mind, and may therefore be executed on large clusters.
